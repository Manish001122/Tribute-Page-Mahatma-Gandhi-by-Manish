<h2>A brief summary of Gandhi's journey</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
    Early life and background. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. 
 , which was then part of the British Empire.
Although young Gandhi wanted to become a doctor, his father, who served as a chief minister in Porbandar, persuaded him to study law.
After 3 years of studies in London (where he became a vegetarian), Gandhi came back to India and tried to start his career as a lawyer.
</p>
<h3>South Africa</h3>
<p>
After struggling to find a job in India, he went to South Africa for a one-year contract to perform legal services. 
Gandhi was there confronted with discrimination against Indian immigrants by British authorities. 
At the end of his contract, Gandhi fought against a bill that would ban Indians from voting. 
Although he didn't stop the bill from passing, it initiated his fight for equality of human rights.
</p>
<h3>Return to India</h3>
<p>
    Gandhi returned to India from South Africa in 1915 at the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale. Lord Chelmsford, the then Viceroy of India, invited Gandhi to Delhi at a War Conference. In order to gain the trust of the empire, Gandhi agreed to move people to enlist in the army for World War I.

</p>


</p>
<h3>India’s Independence</h3>
<p>
After a series of protests, India's independence was inevitable.
The Government of India Act (1935) surrendered significant amounts of power to Indians, and the Indian National Congress clamoured for more.
But after World War II Muslim League demanded that a separate state be created for India's Muslims, and to Gandhi's great distress, the Congress leaders agreed.
In August 1947, India was finally independent, not as a whole but divided into two countries, India and Pakistan. 
</p>
<h3>Assasination</h3>
<p>
Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist, Nathuram Godse, in Delhi on January 30, 1948.
Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacency towards Muslims, holding him responsible for the frenzy of violence and suffering.
Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide, and over a million people joined the five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours. 
</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>
Gandhi's commitment to nonviolence and his belief in simple living — making his clothes, eating a vegetarian diet — has been a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world for decades to come after his death.
Gandhi's actions inspired future human rights movements around the globe, including those of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States and Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
